# Ruby Command Line Whois Utility

## About 
### Version 1.0

Built in ruby using [Simone Carletti's](http://www.simonecarletti.com/ "Simone Carletti") [Ruby Whois](http://www.ruby-whois.org/ "Ruby Whois") client and parser gem.

I built this to make my life easier at work so I can easily run whois queries. I plan on expanding this tool to include other options. 

## Usage

+ System Requirements
  - At least Ruby 1.8.7
  - Ruby Gems Installed
  - "whois" gem installed ``gem install whois``
